30 Days of Different Coding Challenges from HackerRank.com
1) Everyday, complete a new challenge locally on their website.
2) Save code to Git.
3) Replicate on Eclipse and on whiteboard to make sure you know it flawlessly 100% before moving on.
4) Review (read/look over code) from previous days to reinforce what you learned from the beginning to the end where you left off every day.
5) Note: Do one challenge at a time not many challenges at once, but need to learn to be faster. Create comments of CS concepts as you go along. Once you are done with the day's challenge, replicate and review.
