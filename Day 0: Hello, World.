/*
TASK: you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, 
and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

NOTE: Variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

Input Format: A single line of text denoting the variable whose contents must be printed.

On the first line, we print the string literal Hello, World.
On the second line, we print the contents of the variable which, for this sample case, happens to be Welcome to 30 Days of Code!. 
If you do not print the variable's contents to stdout, you will not pass the HIDDEN test case.
